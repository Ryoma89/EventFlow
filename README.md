# EventFlow

## 1. Introduction

### EventFlow Overview

EventFlow is an event management application where users can search for events, register their own events, and recruit participants. The app aims to streamline the process of organizing and discovering events, making it easier for users to connect with and engage in various events.

## 2. Design

### Overview

- **Design Concept**: The main focus is to have a simple and easy-to-use platform, with a clear and understandable layout, being accessible to as many customers as possible whether they want to find events or publish and promote their events.
- **UI/UX Design**: We simplified the search for events with a category filter, as well as a search bar. When creating or editing events, there’s a form, to compile all the information about the events more precisely. As an effort to help people connect about the events, there’s an attendance list, as well as a comment section. Finally, the created and assisting events are compiled in two different lists with the main information displayed and available.
- **Wireframes/Mockups**: There are three main pages for this website, being Home Screen, Event List, and profile, from there, we have the Event Detail Page tailored to every event on the website, which comes from filling out the form to create an event.
